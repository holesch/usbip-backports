# usbip-backports

This project is a backport of the USP/IP driver in the Linux Kernel. It was
created by extracting the directory `drivers/usb/usbip` with the full history
and then adding necessary patches, so that it can be used with older Kernels.

This project aims to supports Kernel versions that are currently used in Ubuntu
LTS releases.
